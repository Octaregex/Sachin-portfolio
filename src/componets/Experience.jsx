        Worked as a Web Development Intern, where I contributed to building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. Gained hands-on experience in developing modern web applications and implementing UI components to enhance user experience. Collaborated remotely with the development team to understand project requirements, fix bugs, and improve existing features.

        <br />
        Key Highlights:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Built responsive pages and reusable React components using JSX and Tailwind CSS.</li>
            <li> Applied JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</li>
            <li> Practiced version control using Git and participated in code reviews.</li>
            <li> Learned to work in a remote team environment, communicating effectively and delivering tasks on time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        This internship strengthened my understanding of front-end development and improved my ability to build real-world projects with modern tools and best practices.
